## Projects

### Recipe

Choose a cooking/baking recipe to share *(and make)*.

- Markup the content first with [semantic HTML](http://w3c.github.io/html-reference/elements-by-function.html).

- Use proper [typographical characters](http://htmlarrows.com) for numbers, punctuation, symbols, etc.
- Photograph the final product (and/or the steps [optional])
- Develop the look and feel of your content
  - Create a [style tile](https://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work)
    - Develop a [color palette](https://htmlcolorcodes.com) based on the colors of your recipe (imagery)
    - Use [accesible colors](http://accessible-colors.com) for accessible color contrasts
    - Use [web-safe fonts](https://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fyti/using-type-tools/fonts-on-the-web), serif or sans-serif, or [both](https://www.cssfontstack.com) (≥90% Win/Mac)
- Use an [external stylesheet](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/#referencing-css)
